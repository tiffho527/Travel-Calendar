1. You push to `main`
2. GitHub Pages deploys directly from `main`
3. Your local `firebase-config.js` works for local development
4. **BUT:** Deployed site won't have Firebase config (it's gitignored)

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Deployed Site Issue

**Problem:** Since `firebase-config.js` is in `.gitignore`, GitHub Pages won't have it!

**Your deployed site will show:** "📴 Offline (Local Mode)"

---

## 🎯 Solution: Two Options

### Option 1: Commit firebase-config.js to main (Simplest)

If you're okay with your API key being public (with restrictions):

```bash
# Remove firebase-config.js from .gitignore
# Edit .gitignore and remove the line: firebase-config.js

# Then commit it
git add firebase-config.js
git commit -m "Add Firebase config for deployment"
git push origin main
```

**Why this is okay:**
- ✅ Firebase API keys are meant to be in client-side code
- ✅ You can restrict the key to your domain only
- ✅ Real security comes from Firebase Security Rules
- ✅ Simplest solution - no multiple branches needed

**Security:** Just restrict your API key to `https://tiffho527.github.io/*`

### Option 2: Use a different deployment platform

Use Netlify or Vercel which support environment variables:
- Upload your site to Netlify/Vercel
- Add Firebase credentials as environment variables
- They inject them at build time
- More complex but keeps credentials truly secret
